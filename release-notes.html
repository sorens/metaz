          By request we are pleased to release Alpha 9 of MetaZ that brings with it a whole host of bug fixes and some
          exciting new features.
        </p>
        <p>
          First off TheTVDB searching now retrieves season posters and UI is improved to let you select the one you prefer
          from all available posters.
        </p>
        <p>A plugin for searching TheMovieDb.org has been added, greatly improving the ease with which movies can be tagged.</p>
        <p>All searching now supports caching which should bring with it some speed improvements</p>
        <p>
          On the downside the Amazon plugin has been temporarily removed because it has been broken since october
          and we haven't gotten around to fixing it yet.
